            <p><br>Scheduled our first meeting with our client on Wednesday, 19 July 2023 at 10 am.
              We have crafted and refined our questions for the requirements-gathering session
              with our client tomorrow. </p>
            <p>Today, our team learned about mental models and how they apply to computing science
              and gathering the requirements of stakeholders in our project. Moreover, we have learned
              to ask good questions using the Mum Test which helped our team craft questions that do not
              provide generic responses such as yes and no. </p>
            <p>We are also in the midst of crafting our team contract.</p>
            <p> The questions prepared by the team for Barclays are: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>What is your reason for creating an autodonate app - what is the goal you want to achieve? </li>
              <li>What would you define as success for this project? </li>
              <li>What makes you different from other donation applications? (Goal of project) </li>
              <li>Based on your customer demographic, how likely do you think users are to adopt this application and
                what can make this number higher? </li>
              <li>What methods could be implemented to accurately track users' spending habits and determine appropriate
                donation amounts? </li>
              <li>How can we incentivize users to use the app regularly and maintain their donation commitments? </li>
              <li>Are there any legal or regulatory considerations that need to be considered when handling financial
                transactions and charitable donations? </li>
              <li>Are there any specific branding or design guidelines that need to be followed to align with Barclays'
                image and values? </li>
              <li>How can the app leverage spending habits to determine suitable charities for individuals? Are there
                any existing data sources or APIs that can be utilised? </li>
              <li>Are there any existing charity partners you would like us to focus on? </li>
              <li>Limitations of charity donations </li>
            </ol>
            <p> Technical Requirements </p>
            <ol>
              <li>What features would users expect in the Auto Donate app? Such as goal tracking, impact stories. </li>
              <li>Is there any preference for the Auto Donate App being a mobile application or web application? If so,
                what? </li>
              <li>Would the app be integrated within the Barclays banking application, or would it be a separate
                application? </li>
              <li>Are there any specific accessibility or inclusivity requirements that the app should meet? </li>
              <li>Which payment processer should we use? And would there be any test APIs for us to use? </li>
              <li>How might the app integrate with existing payment systems and platforms to streamline the donation
                process </li>
            </ol>

          <div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p><br> • Our team met our client today at their office to understand more about what they want from us.
              Based on the information we have gathered from our client, our client is open to having new ideas from
              us. We are also in the midst of working on the prototype which we will finalise by Friday and will start
              on our pitch submission.</p>
            <p> • Our client also stated that the main form of communication will be through email and we will be trying
              Microsoft Teams for the other meetings.</p>
            <p> • Today, our team learned to utilise the pitch feedback form which allows us to understand and know what
              should be done for our pitch submission.</p>
            <p> • The team had a fruitful day speaking to the client at the Barclays Tradescroft Building. We also
              learnt
              that there are many requirements that the team has to ideate upon as the clients themselves are also
              unsure
              of what they want. Further research such as the different charities causes and the target audience is
              needed
              by the team. </p>

            <p> • The Team Contract have also been drafted and fully agreed upon by each team member. Each team member
              intends
              to uphold and honour the Team Contract.</p>

          <h2 class="day-header" id="day-3">Day 3 | 20 July 2023</h2>
          <div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p><br> Following the client's meeting yesterday, the team came out with the meeting minutes for the
              Requirement
              Gathering meeting. Additionally, the team worked on the prototype based on the client's requirement raised
              during the meeting. The team had came out with 2 paper prototypes. A photo of the 2 prototype can be seen
              here:</p>
            <div class="image"><img class="responsive-img" src="assets/img/day3-prototype.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
            <p> The team had incorporated the Barclays' mobile application look and feel into the prototype to provide a
              seamless
              integration with Barclays' existing application. Prototype 1 features asking user about its interest in
              the causes
              that they are passionate about and a curated feed will be shown to the user about relevant causes they
              have indicated.
              In each cause, there is goal tracking to show the total amount of money required for the cause and how
              much has been
              raised so far. The first prototype allows the user to choose either an upfront amount or a recurring
              payment.
              Prototype 2 features a more generic UI, allowing the user to filter the causes and find causes that they
              might be passionate
              about. A donation history page is also featured to allow users to track their donation history, with a
              button for the user
              to make the donation again. </p>

            <p> The prototype will be sent to the client and will be further refined with comments and feedbacks from
              the client.</p>

          <div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p><br> Today the team had a lecture on prototyping. We had learnt about a plethora of prototyping
              techniques such as the rapid
              prototyping and paper-based, some of which are recap of the Human Computer Interaction module. The team
              plans to incorporate
              rapid prototyping in conjunction with interactive mockups later, through the use of Figma, into our
              prototyping process.
              The team understood the importance of the prototyping process and adopted the “fail fast, learn fast”
              mindset as our primary
              objective in the prototyping process.</p>
            <p> The “fail fast, learn fast” methodology allows the team to quickly fail, learn from our mistakes and
              continuously improve
              on the prototype. This methodology fits our use case as the team has the creative liberties on the design
              aspect of the application
              and most importantly, the freedom to fail. IBM mentioned that the costliest failure that an individual can
              make would be investing
              in a project that your customers don't want.</p>
            <p> The team revisited the prototype that we had come out with yesterday and discovered some areas of
              improvement. The team surveyed our
              peers on each prototype, with the majority of responses highlighting what they liked about each prototype.
              In prototype 1, the screen
              to ask the user which causes they are passionate about is a great feature. While in prototype 2, the
              flexibility to cancel or edit
              the amount of monthly donation is the most desired feature amongst those surveyed, as per our requirement
              gathering process. Taking
              this feedback into account, the team will come out with prototype 3 to test our hypothesis that the user
              would experience a seamless
              flow from when clicking the button to enter the auto donate page, to donating to a charity, to looking at
              their donation history, to
              cancelling / editing the monthly donation amount. The following shows the adjustment that the team will be
              making for prototype 3.</p>
            <div class="image"><img class="responsive-img" src="assets/img/day4-prototype.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
            <p> As seen in the image, one of the screens in prototype 2 will be removed in favour of its prototype 1
              counterpart. The goal tracking
              in prototype 1 will then be merged with the first screen in prototype 2, adding the goal tracking
              function. The remaining screens will
              be present in the application. The team unanimously voted to finish prototype 3 next Monday. The team also
              took note that there might
              be further changes to prototype 3 as inspiration comes to us over the weekend. The team will also be
              performing more research as set
              forth in the meeting minutes action items. The link to view the meeting minutes can be found here Meeting
              Minutes.pdf 1. Do note that

            <p> Our priority for next week would be to come out with a further iterated prototype, receive comments on
              the prototype from the clients
              and move towards interactive prototype to produce a hi-fi prototype. The team is proud of the team’s
              current progress and will continue
              this drive next week.</p>

          <h2 class="day-header" id="day-5">Day 5 | 24 July 2023</h2>
          <div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p><br> As planned, today the team worked on creating our third prototype, Prototype 3, by incorporating the
              user feedback from our peers
              that were based on our existing designs from Prototype 1 and 2. The best parts of each of the two older
              prototypes were merged in our
              latest iteration of the design, while keeping the goal of a intuitive interface and a seamless experience
              for our users in mind.
              The photo of Prototype 3 can be seen here:</p>
            <div class="image"><img class="responsive-img" src="assets/img/day5-prototype.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
            <p> It starts with the first two screens of Prototype 1 that allows users to access the Donation page via
              the existing Barcalys application
              interface as the intended design would be integrated with it. As favoured by our surveyees, the users
              would be prompted by a preferences
              screen for which causes they wish to donate to on their first access of the donation page. The user's
              selections would dictate what would
              be recommended by the algorithm to appear on their home screen. The home screen would be a revised version
              of screens from both Prototype
              1 and 2. It would feature the accumulation of the user's donations as ideated in Prototype 2, along with
              the Purchases section where users
              are able to shop for items where the money would be donated to the related causes.</p>
            <p> Based on the user's preferences, users would be able to view the related campaigns that would be
              recommended to the user featuring a Header,
              goad tracking, as well as an additional short description of the campaign as ideated in Prototype 1. The
              images pertaining to the causes would
              still be included which would hopefully invoke empathy for the parties in need. Upon selecting which
              donation fund they wish to donate to,
              they will be prompted with a options selection screen as featured in Prototype 1. This is where the users
              will be able to select the amount
              they wish to donate, whether it be a percentage of their income or a custom amount and also the monthly
              recurring donation option.</p>
            <p> The Donation Subscriptions page of Prototype 2 will be included to provide users an overview of the
              donations that they are currently “subscribed”
              to. Here the ability to view the amounts that they are donating and edit them is retained as it was a
              desired feature of Prototype 2. There would
              also be the option to cancel their subscriptions anytime if they wish to so that there is no pressure on
              the user. This is essentially a combination
              of the My Donation Page & Account page in Prototype 2.</p>
            <p> Finally, the History Page will allow users to view their Donation history while also being able to
              easily select an option to donate again if they wish to.</p>
            <p> By combining the most desired features of our team's ideated prototypes based on the feedback provided
              by our surveyed users, we were able to come up with
              a more cohesive reiteration of our design. The next steps for us in the coming days would be to now gather
              more user feedback regarding our new Prototype
              3 to reiterate another prototype if needed and progress towards an interactive hi-fi prototype of our
              refined design.</p>
